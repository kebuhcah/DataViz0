						While refugee flows in the former Yugoslavia had been ongoing since the beginning of the conflict in 1991,
						1995's Operation Storm - the Croatian Army's final major offensive against rebel Serb forces - resulted in the largest single wave of migration as ethnic Serb residents of the Krajina region fled their homes en masse.
					</p>
					<p>This article from Balkan Insight provides more background to this pivotal event in the Yugoslav Wars, and explores how different interpretations of this operation continue to divide Croatia and Serbia to this day.</p>

					<p>Croatia's campaign to join the European Union brought new impetus to efforts to resolve the remaining disputes among Yugoslavia's successor states, of which the refugee situation was a major component.</p>
					<p>This overview from the Serbian Commissariat for Refugees and Migration details a number of regional initatives that began after 2008, more than decade after the end of armed conflict in Croatia and Bosnia.</p>

					<p>This study, published by a Serbian human rights NGO and co-funded by the Croatian government and the European Union,
					provides a detailed analysis of the current refugee situation in the region, and examines refugees' attitude towards both return to Croatia and local integration in Serbia - 
					which are often complicated by questions of national identity and allegiance.</p>

					<p>While the number of refugees from Croatia and Bosnia in Serbia at the end of the war was roughly equal, refugees from Croatia now constitute around 80% of those remaining in Serbia.</p>
					<p>A major reason for this discrepancy has been the difficulties that Serb refugees face in securing tenancy rights to their prior homes. This study examines these difficulties and their causes in some detail.</p>
